        <p>Program design focuses on breaking down the program into smaller, more manageable components. Various tools are used to help design a proogram

         <P>once the program has been designed a developer then writes the code.

    <P>Coding often involves translating the design from charts into a programming language. Usually the language is chosen during the stage.</P>
