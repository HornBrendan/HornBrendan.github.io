<article><p>   A web designer is an individual that makes thier living maintaining websites. This is a field that has evolved extremely quickly over the past decade, but the fundamentals still remains the same. Any web designer must hvae a strong understanding of the html language developed by Tim Burner Lee in 1989. Since its original development html has come a long way anf has incorporated a multitude of new features. Html allowed for the development of the world wide web and the explosive popularity of the internet.<br>
    
    As html evolved, developers soon realized that the structure of web pages should be defined using html, and the pages style, lok and feel, should be defined seperately, this is the birth of cascading style sheets. Now developers use html to define what the information on the web page, is such as heading content, article content, a paragraph within the article or footer content etc. Cascading sheets were designed to define the colors of document, the size margins, colors, positioning of the various elements of the web page.<br>
